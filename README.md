# -Writing-Basic-SELECT-Queries
 Extract data from one or more tables using SQL
ðŸ”¹ 1. SELECT Statement
The SELECT command is used to retrieve data from a database.

You can retrieve:

All columns using SELECT *

Specific columns by naming them (e.g., SELECT name, salary)

ðŸ”¹ 2. WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter rows based on conditions.

Only rows that meet the condition are included in the result.

Useful for narrowing down data to what you really need.

ðŸ”¹ 3. AND / OR Conditions
AND is used to ensure all conditions are true.

OR is used to allow any one condition to be true.

These help you create more complex filters for your data.

ðŸ”¹ 4. LIKE Operator
Used for pattern matching in text data.

Allows you to search for values that start with, end with, or contain certain letters.

Often used with %, which represents any sequence of characters.

ðŸ”¹ 5. BETWEEN Operator
Checks if a value is within a range (inclusive).

Commonly used with numbers or dates to limit data to a certain period or bracket.

ðŸ”¹ 6. ORDER BY Clause
Sorts the retrieved data in ascending (default) or descending order.

Can sort by one or multiple columns.

Helps organize the result for better readability and analysis.

ðŸ”¹ 7. LIMIT Clause
Restricts the number of rows returned in the result.

Useful for fetching the top or bottom values, like top 5 highest salaries.

Helps in performance when dealing with large datasets.

ðŸŽ¯ Final Outcome
By learning these concepts, you will understand how to:

Retrieve complete or partial data from tables.

Apply filters to get only the required data.

Sort and limit the output for clarity and performance.
